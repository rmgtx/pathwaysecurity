## 6. Instructions for Using This Content

Use the extracted content above to build a new website prototype. Key guidelines:
- **Preserve the messaging hierarchy:** Keep the heading structure (H1 > H2 > H3) and the order of content sections
- **Reuse and adapt the copy:** Use the body text from each section as-is or adapt it for the new context
- **Maintain content types:** Each section is labeled by type (HERO, FEATURES, TESTIMONIAL, etc.) — use these labels to choose appropriate layouts for each section
- **Use the navigation labels:** Build the site navigation from the nav labels listed in Section 3
- **Include meta/SEO content:** Use the page title, meta description, and OG tags from Section 1 for the new page's SEO
- **Reference the image inventory:** Use the image alt texts and roles from Section 5 as guidance for placeholder images or image generation
- **Do NOT replicate the visual design:** This brief is about the content and messaging only. Apply your own visual style, colors, typography, and layout. The goal is same content, different look.
